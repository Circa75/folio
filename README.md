# Folio

A minimalist portfolio website template.

![Alt text](screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

## Description

I love simple portfolios with just the essentials and nothing more â€” Folio is my take on that idea including a short intro section, portfolio grid, arrivals and a contact form. You can use Folio as is, or as a starting point for much more.

## Services

If you need help developing the functionality you need for your own site, I'm available for hire to help you with whatever customization or implementation services you might need. To get started, just send me an email (jason@circa75.co).
